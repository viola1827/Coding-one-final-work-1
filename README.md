Project Description:

In this project, I embarked on creating a net art piece that portrays a dynamic, glowing Spiral Galaxy using p5.js. The journey of crafting this artwork involved several key steps, blending coding with galaxy pattern.

Creating the Basic Shape: 
The foundation of the galaxy was formed by proportionally enlarging and rotating ellipses. This fundamental structure, inspired by a tutorial here, laid the groundwork for the more complex features to follow.

Dynamics of Spiral Galaxy Arms: 
By studying density wave theory, I achieved a rotation effect in the galaxy arms. To enhance realism, I implemented a gradation in size, diminishing progressively from the center, emulating the vast expanse of a real galaxy.

Enhancing Colors and Details: 
Utilizing two color arrays, ‘colorsBlue’ and ‘colorsRed’, I infused warm and cool tones into the galaxy arms, adding depth and luminance. Random values within these arrays brought each spiral arm to life, making them appear more abundant and natural.

Adding Nebulae & Creating Meteors: 
Nebulae were introduced using the HSB color model, adding layers of complexity to the artwork. Furthermore, I incorporated meteors into the galaxy's backdrop, guided by techniques learned from this link, adding a dynamic element to the scene.

Attempting 3D Visualization: 
Transitioning to a 3D view with “WEBGL”, I faced challenges in maintaining the density wave's rotation effect. This endeavor, although challenging, added a new dimension to the artwork.

Debugging and Discovery: 
Despite multiple debugging attempts, achieving a satisfactory rotation in 3D proved difficult. I sought help from ChatGPT for debugging and explored alternative methods for 3D rotation, inspired by examples like this one.

Accidental Discoveries: 
While experimenting with controlling ellipse positions using noise, I stumbled upon a technique that transformed the density wave into a visually appealing three-dimensional form. This unexpected discovery was a testament to the creative process.

In summary, this project was a blend of rotation and color, resulting in a captivating depiction of a Spiral Galaxy. It was a journey of learning, experimenting, and improvising, leading to the creation of a test work.
